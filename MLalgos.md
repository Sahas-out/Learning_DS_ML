# KNN (K closest neighbours)

- Regression: Instead of a vote, KNN takes an average (or weighted average) of the values from those K closest neighbors. This becomes the predicted value for the new data point. Like taking an average answer from your closest classmates on a test.
- problem here is the deciding the optimum k value 

# SVM (Support Vector Machine)

- data isn't always perfectly linearly separable. This is where things get a bit more complex, and SVMs utilize advanced techniques to handle non-linear data.
- SVM create robust decision boundaries, which can be highly effective, especially in scenarios where there is limited data or complex data distributions. This distinguishing characteristic sets SVM apart from other machine learning algorithms and contributes to its versatility and applicability across various domains.

# logistic Regression

- This method is particularly useful when the relationship between the variables is not linear, and it allows for the inclusion of multiple predictors to improve the accuracy of predictions.
